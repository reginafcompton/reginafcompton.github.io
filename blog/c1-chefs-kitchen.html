“[O]nce you start the mental life you pluck the apple. You’ve severed the connexion between the apple and the tree: the organic connexion. And if you’ve go nothing in your life but the mental life, then you yourself are a plucked apple . . . you’ve fallen off the tree.”
Tommy Dukes in <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em> by D.H. Lawrence

D.H. Lawrence published <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em> in 1928. The novel features Constance Chatterley, an aristocratic but despairing housewife, who comes to challenge a societal assumption: pursuits of human intellect have nothing to do with primal passion, emotion, or human urges. Great thinkers are “apples” plucked from an organic life source, as her husband’s colleague Tommy Dukes explains during a circular evening conversation with like-minded peers at Wragby, the Chatterley estate.

I am an Academic, a scholar, a recipient of many (too many) degrees. For me, the Academy came to seem very much like the living room of Lady Chatterley, wherein beautiful minds discussed global and also local issues, some important, some trivial. As it were, this “living room” of scholars can feel suffocating or dishonest. It obeys so many rules of decorum, imposes unrealistic publishing expectations, and adheres to teaching guidelines dictated by administrators – the sort of things that hinder passionate, creative work.

    <p>Lady Chatterley eventually takes a lover and learns to regard her instincts as tightly linked to her mental ability. She opens herself to new physical feelings (sexy, sexy times, of course!), and also she acquires a refreshingly different worldview. At the end of Phase 0, Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp, I feel like Lady Chatterley must have felt as she departed from Wragby. I feel alive, ready to explore new things and experiment with ideas. I am not afraid of making messes. I am not afraid of intangible milestones.</p>
    <p>And still, I do fear my inherent self: I have been trained to work slowly, to think things through at a snail’s pace. I think I will likely struggle to work quickly (though that seems to be a mantra here at Dev Bootcamp). I need to buy some smaller “timeboxes,” I suppose. What I do know, at the very least: Dev Bootcamp celebrates the connection between the “apple and the tree,” something that I find comforting, motivating, and worth waking up for.</p>
