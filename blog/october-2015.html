      <h1>Breathe, Code, Repeat<h1>
      <h4>Posted on October 3, 2015</h4>
      <p>I like free things, especially during this temporary state of non-employment. And since arriving in Chicago, I have attended, nay, taken shameless advantage of free, try-us-out-before-you-buy-a-membership-even-if-you-have-no-intention-of-doing-so yoga at two studios (six classes total, six different instructors). Until last week, I did not fully appreciate the great variety in "yogi" practices. Yoga entails the mindful repetition of postures in sequence: cyclic repetition balances the body, regulates breath, and creates mental focus. Though motivated by the same end goal, yoga instructors, as I now know, cultivate their own sequence of repetition – using modified postures and personalized extensions, performed at different speeds to select music (or, sometimes, no music at all).</p>
      <p>A program running on JavaScript or Ruby can simulate these yoga cycles. These languages provide a way to construct loops, though – like two yoga instructors residing on opposite ends of Chicago – the syntax of repetition varies. The WHILE (Ruby) and FOR (JavaScript)loops provide an example. Such loops tell the computer to repeat something while a certain condition holds true. In Ruby, a WHILE loop looks like this:
      <pre>cycle_num = 1

while cycle_num <= 6
  puts "You are doing #{cycle_num} of 6 horse poses"
  cycle_num += 1
end</pre></p>
      <p>The "cycle_num" variable sets a counter. The program executes the given code (a simple puts statement), while the counter remains less than a given number.</p>
      <p>A FOR loop in JavaScript works the same as the WHILE loop in Ruby. A FOR loop looks like this:
      <pre>for (x = 1; x <= 6; x++) {
  console.log("You are doing " + x + " of 6 horse poses");
}</pre></p>
      <p>The loop sets a variable (x), a condition (while x is less than or equal to), and an additive process (add one to x with every iteration). While the loop condition holds true, the program executes the code between the curly brackets. The result is the same.....</p>
