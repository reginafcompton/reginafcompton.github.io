      <h1>Sn@ail's Tales</h1>
      <p>The posts in this blog examine the cultural and technical landscape of software, web, and app development. The earliest posts (August-September) discuss basic coding principles and tech competencies (e.g., fundamentals of Git and Github). New coders will find this blog most helpful, though seasoned programmers will hopefully find some happy amusement in these playful musings. Perhaps most importantly, this blog traces the very linear, but still exciting, exhausting, and sometimes seemingly impossible journey of a junior programmer, learning about life, love, and code at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

Working with a pair on this project proved useful! My collaborator and I arrived to the challenge already having designed the wireframes for our website. We then discussed how we could modify the basic structure for the Blog page, and we worked out the essential semantic elements of the HTML.

From my partner, I learned about two important resources: (1) Mockflow, a tool for building wireframes, and (2) Collabedit, a collaborative online code editor. (It's AMAZING!) I also got to practice implementing some of the new tags in HTML5: header, main, and footer.
