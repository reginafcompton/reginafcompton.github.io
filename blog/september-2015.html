      <h1>Innumerable<h1>
      <h4>Posted on September 19, 2015</h4>
      <p>My last post explored the differences and similarities between two types of containers: arrays (lists of objects ordered numerically) and hashes (lists of objects organized into key-value pairs). Hashes and arrays bring order to our disorganized, complex, troubling, exhilarating, confusing, beautiful world. Nonetheless, the full organizational potential of hashes and arrays exists not in the containers themselves, but in the myriad ways we can access and manipulate them.</p>
      <p>Behold. The innumerable. <em>Innumerable</em>, or the innumerable module, bestows objects with great power. It allows objects to access bundles of methods. These methods depend upon the notion of .each, which helps us iterate over collections by pushing each element into a code block, as in this example:
        <pre>array.each {|x| puts x }</pre>
      </p>
      <p>Innumerable methods offer more subtle, often more powerful variants of the .each method. .each_with_index</p>

      <h1>Containers, Collections, Chicago<h1>
      <h4>Posted on September 13, 2015</h4>
      <p>I recently moved into a studio apartment in the heart of Chicago (Near North Side). I can walk to Oak Street Beach, Navy Pier, and on particularly nice days, Millennium Park. Though a portal into the beauty of Chicagoland, my apartment – due to it spacial limitations – demands an exhaustive system of organization. I thus use various containers (boxes, Tupperware, shelving units, etc.) to establish order. Some of these storage containers place my belongings into a precise, linear order: the top drawer of my (modest) dresser holds underwear, the second drawer – bras, the third – socks and running shorts, and the bottom – leggings. I also have a refrigerator, which contains structure, but not precise, numerical order: when I buy a new food item, I put it in the fridge, where it resides until I eat it or replace it with something else.<p>
      <p>Arrays and hashes work similarly. They are containers (or lists) for objects. The objects in an array appear between brackets, like so: <pre>dresser_drawers = ["underwear", "bras", "socks and shorts", "leggings"]</pre></p>
      <p>An array organizes its contents in numerical order, starting at zero. In the "dresser_drawers" array, "underwear" sits in the zeroth position, "bras" sit in the first position, and so on. Hashes are also containers that organize lists of objects. Hashes, however, present a slightly more sophisticated if less linear system of order. The objects in a hash appear between two curly brackets, and each object contains two parts – a key and its value, like so: <pre>refrigerator = { "cheese_drawer" => "Parmesan",
        "vegetable_crisper" => "corn",
        "bottom_shelf" => "milk"
        "door" => "butter" }</pre></p>
      <p>The hash array collects each object, not according to a numerical index, but rather according to the objects themselves. Therefore, to access an object in the array, I simply call the object by its name, not by it integer position. Like the containers in my studio apartment, arrays and hashes serve different, but equally useful purposes – helping to bring order and structure to the world around us.</p>

      <h1>The World Wide Web According to Bach</h1>
      <h4>Posted on September 4, 2015</h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/BOZEj8wyj-I" target="_blank">first movement</a> of Bradenburg Concerto No. 1 by JS Bach (1685-1750) contains a handful of musical ideas: an oscillating melody in the violins and oboes superimposed over a disruptive "hunting" horn call. The <a href="https://youtu.be/4WNykhWtn1I?t=22m43s" target="_blank">fourth movement</a> of Symphony No. 82 by Josef Haydn (1732-1809) presents one prominent melody, a playful pastoral dance, that recurs in every section and subsection of the movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8WCgXAPZRAI" target="_blank">String Quartet, Op. 28</a> by Anton Webern (1883-1945) contains a four-note cell – a reference to Bach's name – that repeats and repeats, providing the basic musical material for the entire piece.</p>
      <p>Written by composers from three very different historical moments, these works present examples of, what some thinkers call, "motivic economy," a principle of music composition that celebrates efficient repetition. This principle, in one sense, suggests that repetition creates coherency, intelligibility, and beauty. Repetition, in other words, makes masterworks masterful.</p>
      <p>To write good CSS requires some understanding of Bach, Haydn, and Webern – or, at least, an understanding of motivic economy. HTML gives the website its basic content, and CSS shapes, colors, and brings to life the elements of HTML. CSS and HTML files thus communicate together. An HTML file contains elements...and elements within elements...and elements within elements within elements. An element can indicate a header, a paragraph, a blockquote, and about one hundred other "semantic" things. The CSS file selects these elements and adds style to them.</p>
      <p>In HTML, "class" labels can appear next to elements, e.g., <strong>p class="ex-l"</strong>. The class – a type of CSS selector – prepares the element for styling in CSS: the class can receive several style values, which are then applied to the element itself in the HTML. Several elements can share a class. For instance, all link elements (the "a" tag) and headers (the "h" tags) might share a class of "strong." In the CSS, the "strong" class could receive, let's say, a font-weight of bold: all links and headers on the site would in turn be bolded.</p>
      <p>"ID" labels can also appear next to elements, e.g., <strong>p id="p-xs"</strong>. However, IDs do not function as classes do. An ID is unique; it can only select one element, one time. IDs can be useful, if the site has an element with very specific styling needs (perhaps, a detail in the footer or an aside). Still, an HTML file with an excess of IDs likely has some problems: mainly, the code lacks "motivic economy." A plethora of IDs results in verbose, bombastic, ineloquent CSS files. Whereas, a collection of cleverly organized classes creates intelligible, precise CSS, the kind of CSS that Bach, Haydn, or Webern might write.</p>
