I closely watched J. Ky Marsh's presentation on responsive design and Twitter, which encouraged me to really contemplate the capabilities of CSS. I did not use "Atomic" tags, as he suggests, but I did start to think about my website as a series of rows and columns. I used a "row" class in my website (to encase the <header>, <main>, and <footer> tags). The CSS for my row class is basic: padding 0, margin 0, width 100%, display: block, and float: left. The width setting requires the row to fill the entire page, and the display setting translates the element as a block, wherein no other elements can sit next to it. The "float" property makes the row responsive â€“ I do not quite understand how or why, but it seems to work. (Mysteries. Miracles.) For columns, I used Marsh's calculations, i.e., twelve "span" classes, each with a percentage width.

A significant part of the development process was crafting the header. I used the float property to position the two divs (logo and nav, left and right, respectively). I used an unordered list to organize the elements in my nav bar: I removed the bullet points with the "list-style" property, and I made the list items sit next to each other with the float property. (I believe that you can also use "display: inline-block" to get similar results.) Frustratingly, the nav items do not seem to be perfectly responsive: in a smaller window, they do not stack nicely, one on-top-of-the-other.

The rest of the site came together without too much struggle or homicidal rage. I learned how to add a "box-shadow," which adds some depth to the page. In addition, I learned to track my reusable classes: the <a> tag appears throughout my site, so I included in the CSS a standard style for this.
